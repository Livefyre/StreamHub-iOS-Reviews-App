StreamHub-iOS-Reviews-App
=========================


If you haven't already, please install CocoaPods first [[2]]. You can do this
simply by running `gem install cocoapods` and `pod setup`. Once installed,
do the following (assuming you keep your projects in `~/dev` directory):

    cd ~/dev
    git clone https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-iOS-Reviews-App.git
    cd StreamHub-iOS-Reviews-App
    pod install
    open LivefyreReviews.xcworkspace

Note that the `pod install` step above can take a minute or two. When done
installing, use `LivefyreReviews.xcworkspace` to open the project instead of the
`LivefyreReviews.xcproject` file.
